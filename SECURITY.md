# Security Policy

Security is important for this project and its community. 🔒

## Supported Versions

The latest version or release is supported.

Keep dependencies and your application up to date after ensuring tests pass, so you benefit from the latest features and **security fixes**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability (or are unsure), please report it as soon as possible:

- **Preferred**: Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/viethqb/pydbapi/security/advisories/new) in this repository (GitHub: Security → Advisories).
- **Alternatively**: Contact the project maintainers (e.g. via the contact method listed in the repository or your organization).

Please include clear steps and example code to reproduce the issue.

## Public Discussions

Please do **not** discuss potential security vulnerabilities in public issues or discussions. 🙊

Report them privately first so impact can be limited.
